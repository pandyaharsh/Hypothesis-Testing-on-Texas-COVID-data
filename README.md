# Hypothesis-Testing-on-Texas-COVID-data
This is project that I got for one of my coure work, this was a group project. We were given multiple Hypothesis and our task was to prove them right or wrong.
Follwing are the Hypothesis:
Hypothesis 1: "A higher hospitalization rate gives a higher fatality rate"
Hypothesis 2: "A higher ICU rate gives a higher fatality rate"
Hypothesis 3: "As restriction lifted with Open Texas the rate of infection increased, with a slight delay."
Hypothesis 4: "More testing leads to lower transmission later"
Hypothesis 5: "Higher population density means higher transmission rate"
Hypothesis 6: "Rural counties neighboring urban had higher rates than those not near urban areas"
Hypothesis 7: "Travel Within Counties Contributed to Increased Cases"
Hypothesis 8: Rural counties (low population) had less spread
